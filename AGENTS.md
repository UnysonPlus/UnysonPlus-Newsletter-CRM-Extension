# Newsletter / Subscriber CRM — working rules

The storage + management layer under the existing `[newsletter]` shortcode. Read this
before editing anything in this folder.

## The layering is the design — do not shortcut it

```
Installer   framework/extensions/newsletter-crm/includes/class-fw-newsletter-crm-installer.php
Repository  …-subscribers.php · …-lists.php
Service     …-service.php
Providers   includes/providers/…
Admin/REST  …-admin-page.php · …-list-table.php · …-csv.php · …-rest.php
```

Two rules keep it honest, and every future feature (campaigns, automations, ESP
add-ons) depends on them:

- **Nothing above the repository writes SQL.** Need a new query? Add a repository
  method. Never `$wpdb->prepare()` in an admin class, a provider, or the service.
- **Nothing below the service fires a hook.** The repositories are dumb on purpose —
  they hold no business rules and emit no actions, so a bulk operation can call them
  in a loop without side effects.

The service is the only entry point outsiders (and our own admin screen, importer,
capture hook and REST controller) call. A rule such as "a re-signup reactivates rather
than duplicating" or "double opt-in means `pending`" exists there exactly once.

## Schema discipline (this is the plugin's FIRST custom-table extension)

`dbDelta` is picky by contract — **two spaces after `PRIMARY KEY`**, one field per
line, lowercase type keywords, `KEY` never `INDEX`, and the collation from
`$wpdb->get_charset_collate()`. Break any of those and it silently re-runs `ALTER`s on
every load.

- Guarded by the `fw_ext_newsletter_crm_db_version` option, compared against
  `FW_Newsletter_CRM_Installer::DB_VERSION`. **Bump that constant whenever you change
  the schema**, or the change never reaches an existing site.
- The check runs on every `_init()` — one autoloaded `get_option()` when current — so
  activation *and* plugin-update upgrades self-heal with no activation hook to miss.
- `dbDelta` adds columns and indexes; it **never drops or renames**. Anything
  destructive is a numbered, version-guarded block in `Installer::migrate()`.
- Tables use `$wpdb->prefix` (per-site), **not** `base_prefix` — on multisite each site
  keeps its own subscribers, which is right for the demos network and for real networks.
- **Deactivating never drops a table.** Data removal is the explicit, opt-in "Remove all
  data" action on the Settings tab, and nothing else may call `Installer::uninstall()`.

## Things that will bite you if you change them

- **`fw_newsletter_subscribe` is an ACTION fired BEFORE the result filter**, so the
  capture hook cannot reject a signup from inside it. It stores, stashes any `WP_Error`
  keyed by normalised email, and `fw_newsletter_subscribe_result` (hooked later) reports
  it. Don't "simplify" that into one callback.
- **Never delete a row on unsubscribe.** A forgotten address is silently re-subscribed
  by the next import. Opt-out = `status` + `unsubscribed_at`, row retained. Same reason
  the GDPR eraser anonymises in place instead of deleting.
- **Never `SELECT`-then-`INSERT` on email.** The `UNIQUE (email)` index is the dedupe
  point; `Subscribers::upsert()` already handles the lost-race case.
- **Emails are normalised (lowercase + trim) by `Subscribers::normalize_email()`** for
  storage, lookup and dedupe alike. Never compare raw input against a stored address.
- **CSV export must stay on the `load-` hook** — it streams headers and `exit`s, which
  is impossible once any HTML has been printed. Cells starting with `= + - @` are
  apostrophe-prefixed; keep `escape_cell()` in the path or you have reintroduced CSV
  injection into Excel.
- **Import defaults to skipping people whose stored status is `unsubscribed`.** The
  override is a deliberate, labelled checkbox. Don't make it the default.
- **Tokens are credentials, not data** — never expose `confirm_token` /
  `unsubscribe_token` through REST, CSV or the admin table.
- **The confirm link must not confirm on a bare GET.** Corporate mail scanners and
  security products auto-visit every URL in an inbound email, so a GET-confirms link
  lets a robot opt someone in — which defeats double opt-in entirely. The GET renders
  a page with a button that POSTs. `confirm_on_visit` exists for sites that knowingly
  trade that away; don't make it the default.
- **Unsubscribe MUST accept a bare POST with no confirmation step.** That is RFC 8058
  one-click, which the `List-Unsubscribe-Post` header promises and which Gmail/Yahoo
  require of bulk senders. A mail client cannot send a nonce, which is exactly why the
  token is the credential. Adding a confirmation step to the POST path would break it.
- **Confirm tokens are single-use and expire (48h, filterable); the unsubscribe token
  never expires** — it lives in the footer of every email ever sent, so expiring it
  would strand people with a dead opt-out link. Keep them in separate columns.
- **The public endpoints are query args on the home URL, not rewrite rules.** Rules
  need flushing on activation and Unyson extensions have no activation hook we can
  rely on — a stale rewrite cache would 404 every confirmation link, silently. Don't
  "improve" these into pretty permalinks without solving the flush properly.
- **All mail goes through `wp_mail()`.** The Mailer/SMTP extension governs transport,
  From address and authentication; a raw `mail()` call breaks SPF/DKIM alignment on
  every site that configured it.
- **The mail class hooks the lifecycle actions rather than being called from the
  service.** That is deliberate dogfooding — if `FW_Newsletter_CRM_Mail` were deleted
  the store would still work. Don't move sending into the service.
- **Lists and tags are ONE table** discriminated by `type`, with ONE polymorphic pivot
  (`subscriber_id`, `object_id`, `object_type`). Do not add a parallel tags table, and
  do not add a `tags` column to the subscriber row — both were considered and rejected
  (see the Phase 0 report).
- **A segment is a saved query** (`segments.filters` JSON, in the same arg shape
  `Subscribers::query()` takes). Never denormalise membership into a table. Keep
  `Service::sanitize_segment_filters()` in the save path — it strips paging, ordering
  and any explicit `ids`, which is what stops a segment silently becoming a frozen
  snapshot of whoever matched on the day it was saved.
- **`add_to_list()` returns TRUE only when a row was actually created.** It leans on
  `INSERT IGNORE`, and `$wpdb->query()` returns **0** affected rows on a duplicate —
  `0 !== false` is true, so the obvious `false !== query()` reports every no-op as a
  change. That bug made "tagged N subscribers" count people who already had the tag.
- **The Subscribers screen is ONE `method="get"` form** (core's `edit.php` pattern),
  because WP_List_Table's filter dropdowns live inside its own tablenav — split them
  across two forms, or make it POST, and filtering stops surviving into the URL while
  pagination links silently drop it. Bulk actions ride the same form, nonced under
  `bulk-subscribers`, and every handler PRG-redirects so nothing re-fires on refresh.

## The campaign previewer must go through the SEND path

`Service::preview()` takes the same `$data` shape as `save_campaign()` so the editor can
preview **unsaved** work — a preview you must save first is one nobody uses while
iterating. It persists nothing.

- **It calls the same functions `Sender::send_one()` calls, in the same order** —
  `with_unsubscribe()` → `Mail::replace()` → `Mail::render_body()`. Reimplementing any
  part of that here would produce a preview that quietly diverges from the real email,
  which is worse than no preview. The test asserts the output is **byte-identical** to
  what the sender would build; keep that assertion.
- **The stand-in recipient is synthetic, with empty tokens** (`preview_subscriber()`).
  Rendering against a real subscriber would make every link in the preview LIVE —
  including the unsubscribe link, which the admin, a link prefetcher or a corporate
  scanner could fire and opt a real person out just by looking at a draft.
- **The plain-text part goes through `replace()` too.** A text part still reading
  "Hi {{first_name}}" beside HTML reading "Hi Alex" is exactly the divergence a preview
  exists to catch.
- **The iframe is `sandbox=""` with no allow-* tokens.** It renders whatever the author
  put in a Raw HTML block, so it must not run script, submit forms, navigate the admin
  page, or reach back into it via same-origin. `srcdoc` still works fully sandboxed.
- The new-tab route serves the compiled document **as the document**, with no admin
  chrome around it, so what the tab renders is what an inbox receives.

## The site title reaches readers as PLAIN TEXT — one helper decides

`Mail::site_name()` strips tags rather than escaping them, and every place the title can
reach a reader goes through it: the `{{site_name}}` placeholder, the Logo block's text
fallback and its `alt`, and the plain-text renderer.

The reason is concrete. A site title may legitimately contain **markup** — the Site
Converter emits a two-tone wordmark like `My<span class="accent">Company</span>` and the
theme prints `site_title` raw — so `esc_html()` on that mails the reader a literal
`&lt;span class="accent"&gt;`. Keeping the tag is not an option either: there is no
stylesheet in an inbox, so the class would do nothing even if it survived. And letting raw
markup through `{{site_name}}` would mean a theme setting could inject arbitrary HTML into
every email. Plain text is the only honest rendering, so don't "fix" this back to
`esc_html( get_bloginfo( 'name' ) )`.

**A silent fallback needs a visible field.** The Logo block always fell back
image → Customizer logo → site title, but had no field for that last step — so on a
converted site the wordmark appeared in the email out of nowhere with nothing in the panel
to change it. It now has a `text` option (empty = the site title) which also serves as the image's
alt text. The live title goes in the field's **placeholder**, never spliced into the
description: a placeholder is the affordance for "what you get if you leave this
blank", it greys out like the hint it is, and it keeps the description a fixed,
translatable sentence instead of one carrying a site-specific name. Treat that
as the rule: if a block resolves something implicitly, the panel has to say so.

## The email template library is the FRAMEWORK's, not ours

`FW_Option_Type_Email_Builder::_get_defaults()` sets **`'template_saving' => true`**, and that
one flag is the whole feature: the Templates panel, save-canvas-as-template, load, delete and
JSON export/import all come from the builder extension, exactly as they do for the page
builder. Storage is scoped by builder type (`fw:bt:f:email-builder:…`), so an email template
can never show up in the page builder's list. Do not write a second library.

Our starters ride the framework's own hook,
`fw_ext_builder:predefined_templates:email-builder:full`, from
`FW_Newsletter_CRM_Email_Templates`.

- **Starters are authored as PHP, not pasted JSON.** A template stores option VALUES, so it
  goes stale the moment a block's options change — the same trap the theme Preset Library has.
  As code, a renamed option is a visible edit in a reviewed file; a frozen JSON blob rots
  silently and is only discovered by a user opening a broken template. They are built through
  `Compiler::to_option_value()` for the same reason: a starter is produced by the same code
  that loads a saved campaign, so it follows any change to the tree shape instead of becoming
  the one shape nothing else produces.
- **Every starter ends with a footer block, and hardcodes almost no colour.** The footer is
  not decoration — bulk mail needs a visible opt-out and, in most jurisdictions, a postal
  address, so a starter without one teaches people to send non-compliant email. Colours are
  left empty so they inherit the campaign defaults and the site's palette shows through; a
  starter is a starting point, not a theme. The test suite asserts both.

## A COMPILED body is stored verbatim — kses would mangle it

`Campaigns::sanitize()` runs `wp_kses_post()` on `body`, **except** when
`Mail::is_document()` says the body is a complete document. This is not an optimisation, it
is a correctness fix: `wp_kses_post()` strips `<style>` (which dumped the mobile-stacking CSS
into the stored body as visible text) and entity-escapes the Outlook conditional comments
carrying the ghost tables and the VML button fallback — so a builder campaign was being
**mangled on save**, before the sender ever saw it.

Nothing untrusted is being let through. A compiled document is assembled by our own compiler
out of per-block option values, each already sanitised by its option type on the way in — the
author never hands us that string. A body typed into the visual editor is where author markup
actually arrives, and it still goes through kses. Same test, same reasoning, as
`render_body()` and `with_unsubscribe()`; keep all three on `is_document()`.

## Adding an ESP provider

Subclass `FW_Newsletter_CRM_Provider`, register on
`unysonplus_newsletter_crm_providers`. The contract was designed against Mailchimp,
MailerLite and Brevo — all three are **email-keyed upserts**, so `subscribe()` takes the
whole subscriber and the adapter decides how to be idempotent (Mailchimp's
`md5(lowercased email)` in the URL, MailerLite's POST-is-upsert, Brevo's
`updateEnabled`). Return `true` or a `WP_Error`, never a bare bool, so a caller can tell
"rejected" from "429, retry later". Remote list IDs are **mapped, never guessed** —
`map_list_id()`. A provider failing must never lose the local signup: the service records
the error in subscriber meta and carries on.

## Versioning + mirroring

Per the workspace rules: bump `manifest.php` on every meaningful change here, mirror to
every `D:\xampp\htdocs` install, and leave the CORE version (`unysonplus.php` +
`framework/manifest.php`) alone until the confirmed-milestone / release step. Repo:
`UnysonPlus-Newsletter-CRM-Extension` (repo root = this folder).

## Campaign sending — the rules that keep it correct

Everything about `FW_Newsletter_CRM_Sender` follows from three facts about WP-Cron.
None of them are negotiable; if you change this code, re-read them first.

1. **WP-Cron fires on page loads, not on a clock, and can fire the same event twice
   concurrently.** Hence the lock. It uses `add_option()` because that is **atomic** —
   `option_name` carries a UNIQUE index, so exactly one racer can create it. A
   transient is **not** atomic under an external object cache and both racers win.
   The lock is stolen after `LOCK_TTL`, or a worker that died mid-send would stall
   the queue for ever. `run()` releases it in a `finally`.
2. **A PHP timeout mid-batch is normal, not an edge case.** That is the entire reason
   `fw_crm_campaign_queue` exists — one row per recipient, flipped the moment it is
   handled. A campaign row alone cannot answer "who did we already send to?", so a
   killed request would either double-send or silently drop people. Never replace it
   with a counter.
3. **The ceiling is the mail host's rate limit, not PHP.** Batch size is a setting,
   small by default, capped at 500.

Also load-bearing:

- **Eligibility is re-checked at SEND time**, not only when the queue was built.
  Someone can unsubscribe in between, and mailing them anyway is exactly the
  complaint we must never earn. Those rows are marked `skipped`, not `sent`.
- **Only `subscribed` is ever queued.** `Campaigns::audience_args()` *forces*
  `status = 'subscribed'` over whatever the audience says — pending people never
  agreed, and unsubscribed/bounced/complained must never be mailed again.
- **A campaign is read-only once sending starts.** Editing mid-send means half the
  list got a different email from the other half.
- **Pause keeps the queue.** Resume continues; it does not restart.
- **The audience is a live query resolved ONCE, at send time**, then frozen into
  queue rows — a send needs a fixed, countable recipient set or progress is
  meaningless.
- **A body without `{{unsubscribe_url}}` gets an unsubscribe line appended.** Bulk
  email must always carry a visible opt-out; don't make that optional.
- Deleting the extension's data calls `Sender::unschedule()` **before** dropping
  tables — a scheduled tick against dropped tables fatals on the next page load.

## One body pipeline — never call `wpautop()` directly

`Mail::render_body()` is the single path every outgoing message takes: `wp_kses_post` →
`make_clickable` → `maybe_autop` → the shared HTML shell. Campaigns use it too, on
purpose — a second near-copy in the sender would drift.

**A body that is already a complete document short-circuits that pipeline**
(`Mail::is_document()`). The email builder compiles a whole `<!doctype html>` document,
and running the FRAGMENT pipeline over it did real damage: `wp_kses_post()` strips
`<style>`, which dumped the mobile-stacking CSS into the message as **visible text**,
and the finished document was then nested inside a second shell with its own padding
and background. That shipped in real sends, not just previews — the campaign previewer
is what surfaced it. Sanitising is not lost, only relocated: a compiled document is
assembled by our own compiler from per-block values already sanitised on save, so it
never carries unreviewed author markup. `Sender::with_unsubscribe()` asks the same
question, because appending its opt-out line after `</html>` puts it outside the
document where clients may drop it — which would silently produce bulk mail with no
opt-out at all. Keep both on `is_document()`; two copies of that test would drift.

`maybe_autop()` applies `wpautop()` **only when the body has no block-level markup of
its own**. The plain-text confirmation/welcome templates need autop; a campaign written
in `wp_editor` is already full of `<p>` tags and re-wrapping it double-paragraphs and
wrecks the spacing. That bug is exactly what the rich editor would have introduced, so
don't "simplify" this back to an unconditional `wpautop()`.

The editor ID is `fw_crm_body` — `wp_editor()` accepts **only lowercase letters and
underscores** in an ID, and a hyphen silently breaks TinyMCE with no error. A campaign
that has started sending renders a read-only preview instead of an editor, because
TinyMCE has no honest disabled state.

## The Email Builder — a compiler with a UI attached

`FW_Option_Type_Email_Builder` is the framework's **fourth** builder subclass (after
the Page Builder, the Forms extension's Form Builder and the Learning extension's Quiz
Builder). The canvas, item tray, reorder/clone/delete and options modal are all
inherited — read the Quiz Builder if you need the pattern, it is the closest analogue
because its items render their own markup rather than delegating to shortcodes.

Rules that are load-bearing:

- **Blocks compile themselves to nested tables with INLINE styles**, and each returns a
  **self-contained table**, never a bare `<tr>` — the compiler places a block either in a
  full-width row or inside a column, and only a self-contained table works in both.
  (Same reason MJML makes every component a table.) Use `wrap_block()`.
- **No flex, no grid, no float — ever.** But note the nuance: **divs and one class ARE
  used, for columns only.** The hybrid column pattern is an MSO ghost table with a real
  `<td>` per column for Outlook, plus inline-block `<div class="fw-crm-col">` for
  everyone else, plus a media query that stacks them on mobile. MJML's own output does
  exactly this. Layout still never *depends* on `<style>`: the inline `max-width` does
  the splitting, and the media query only stacks.
- **The column container sets `font-size:0`, and each column resets it.** HTML whitespace
  *between* inline-block elements renders as a visible gap and breaks the column maths.
  Don't remove it.
- **Outlook will not stack columns on mobile** — it ignores media queries. That is
  correct and expected: the Word engine is desktop-only.
- Gmail strips `<style>` in clipped views, so anything in there is *enhancement only* —
  never make it load-bearing.
- **The Button block needs its VML fallback and an explicit width.** A CSS-styled `<a>`
  collapses to a bare link in classic Outlook, and VML cannot size itself.
- **`body_json` is the source of truth; `body` holds the compiled HTML**, written on
  save. That is what keeps the entire sending stack (queue, batching, test sends,
  `render_body()`) unaware the builder exists, and why visual-editor campaigns still
  work — they simply have no block tree. Do not make the sender read `body_json`.
- **Switching to the visual editor clears `body_json`**, so the tree and the HTML can
  never disagree about what is actually sent.
- **Two value shapes exist and both must keep working.** The framework's builder stores
  a block's values under `options`; hand-authored trees and fixtures use `atts`.
  `Compiler::block_atts()` accepts either, and `to_option_value()` normalises `atts` →
  `options` on the way into the canvas (otherwise an imported tree loads as a row of
  empty blocks).
- **The option value itself is `array( 'json' => '<string>' )`**, not a bare array.
  `normalize()` unwraps it; `to_option_value()` re-wraps it. Hand a bare array to
  `render_options()` and the canvas comes up empty.
- **Every block must be registered in JS as well as PHP**, or the canvas logs "Cannot
  detect Item type" and renders nothing for a saved tree. One generic registration in
  `static/js/email-builder.js` is driven by localized data, rather than four
  near-identical scripts.
- **Columns come from per-block widths, not a nested container.** Each block carries a
  `width` (`1_2`, `1_3`, …) set by the FRAMEWORK's `FwBuilderComponents.ItemView.WidthChanger`
  — the same component the Learning extension's quiz builder uses. `Compiler::pack_rows()`
  groups *consecutive* blocks while their widths still fit; a full-width block always
  stands alone. Our width vocabulary is registered through the
  `fw_builder_item_widths:email-builder` filter and is deliberately coarse — the page
  builder's twelfths give a ~50px column in a 600px email.
- **Unknown block types are skipped, never guessed** — a tree saved by a newer version
  must not email somebody garbage. They also never join a column row.
- Keep the output-size estimator honest: Gmail clips beyond ~102 KB and table structure
  can break mid-render.

### The 14 blocks, and what each one is actually for

Tray order is deliberate — top-of-email first, then structure, then chrome:

`logo`, `heading`, `text`, `image`, `button`, `divider`, `spacer`, `menu`, `social`,
`hero`, `video`, `table`, `footer`, `html`.

Non-obvious decisions worth not re-litigating:

- **Social ships NO icon set.** SVG is stripped by Gmail and ignored by Outlook, so the
  only working alternative would be bundling raster brand marks — third-party trademarks
  we would be redistributing, plus a re-cut every rebrand. Each link therefore renders as
  a styled **text link** (100% reliable everywhere) and takes an **optional uploaded
  icon** for sites with their own set. Same one-row/one-cell-per-link layout as `menu`,
  because it is the only arrangement email keeps on a line without floats.
- **`video` never embeds video.** No client plays it. It renders a linked poster image
  with a play overlay; the caption + URL carry it in the plain-text part.
- **`hero` emits a VML `<v:rect>`/`<v:fill>` fallback** for its background image, for the
  same reason the button does — Outlook drops CSS backgrounds.
- **`logo` falls back**: uploaded image → the Customizer logo → the site title as text.
  It has no `alt` option of its own; it always uses the site name, and the plain-text
  renderer does the same.
- **`html` honours `unfiltered_html` at COMPILE time** (i.e. the saving user's caps),
  which only works because compilation happens on save. If compilation ever moves to
  send time, that check has no user to check against — revisit it before changing when
  the compile runs.
- **`footer` exists mostly to prompt for the postal address** CAN-SPAM/GDPR require, and
  to keep the unsubscribe link a first-class, styleable thing rather than a bolt-on.
- **`table` takes pipe-separated rows**, which are already readable plain text — so
  `to_plain_text()` passes them straight through rather than converting anything.

- **A block's `enqueue_static()` MUST enqueue its OPTIONS' static**, which the base
  class now does for every block:
  `fw()->backend->enqueue_options_static( $this->get_options() )`. The options modal is
  rendered by the `fw_backend_options_render` ajax action, which returns **HTML and
  nothing else** — no scripts, no styles. So an option type whose JS is not already on
  the page renders as inert markup: wp-editor as a bare textarea with a dead Visual tab,
  color-picker as a plain box, upload as a dead button. It is a silent failure with no
  console error, which makes it very easy to misdiagnose as "the editor is broken". The
  Forms extension's builder items do the same thing for the same reason.
- **Pixel fields are `unit-input` with px as the only unit**, via `px_option()`. Email has
  no viewport units, Outlook resolves neither rem nor em, and percentages are unreliable
  inside table cells — px is the only length the whole client matrix agrees on. The unit
  picker still earns its place by labelling the number.
- **`px()` accepts BOTH value shapes.** A `unit-input` stores
  `array( 'value' => …, 'unit' => 'px' )`; campaigns saved before those fields became unit
  inputs hold a bare string. Stored trees are never migrated — they are read by whatever
  version is running — so both must keep working forever.
- **Every block's options live in `group` containers** (`group_content` / `group_style` /
  `group_layout`), because the framework draws a rule between top-level option rows — a
  flat list of eight options rendered as eight underlined bands. A `group` is a plain
  display wrapper, so the rule falls only between groups. Critically it does **not** nest
  values: `fw_get_options_values_from_input()` flattens it, so `$atts['padding']` is still
  `$atts['padding']` and no stored tree needed migrating.

- **"Extra styles" is INLINE DECLARATIONS, never a CSS rule.** Every block carries one
  (appended centrally in `get_options()`, so no block can be built without it). It writes
  into the block's own `style=""`, last, so the author's declarations win.
  This is not a simplification of a Custom CSS box — it is the only honest version of one.
  A page builder's Custom CSS writes a scoped RULE into a stylesheet; an email has no
  stylesheet worth depending on (Gmail drops everything past ~102 KB, taking `<style>` with
  it, and styles are commonly stripped on forward). A rule here would work while the author
  tested it and silently vanish for part of their list, with no way to tell. Inline is the
  one layer every client honours, so that is the layer this writes to.
  `sanitize_extra_styles()` allow-lists by SHAPE — every part must look like
  `property: value` — so selectors, at-rules and stray braces are rejected as a consequence
  of the format rather than as special cases somebody has to remember to add. On top of that
  it drops the genuinely dangerous CSS (`expression()`, `javascript:`/`vbscript:` URLs,
  `behavior:`, `@import`, `data:text/html`) and strips `<`/`>` and comments. Quotes are
  deliberately NOT stripped — `font-family:'Segoe UI'` needs them and `esc_attr()` already
  makes them safe.
- **The compiler calls `render()`, not `compile()`.** `render()` stashes the block's values
  so shared helpers (`wrap_block()`) can reach them, then clears them in a `finally` so
  nothing leaks between blocks. Two blocks build their own wrapper instead of using
  `wrap_block()` — Hero and Spacer — and merge the extra styles themselves; if you add
  another such block, do the same or its Extra styles field will silently do nothing.
- **Alignment is the `image-picker` swatch control**, via `align_option()`, so it matches
  the shortcodes' alignment field everywhere in the plugin. The three SVGs are **copied
  into this extension**, not borrowed through `sc_alignment_field()`: the CRM is documented
  to work with the shortcodes extension inactive, and a control that silently degrades from
  swatches to radios depending on what else is switched on is worse than either one
  consistently. `image-picker` itself is core framework, so nothing here is a
  cross-extension dependency. Unlike the shortcode version there is deliberately **no
  "Default" swatch** — that one means "inherit from the theme/parent" and an email has no
  such cascade, so it would be a control that does nothing.
 `radio-text` appends a free-text "other"
  row, which offered a text box for a value that can only ever be `left`/`center`/`right`.

When you add a block: implement `compile()`, `get_type()`, `get_thumbnails()` and
**`get_preview_keys()`** (the canvas summary is data-driven from those keys — no JS edit
needed), register it in `Email_Builder::_init()`'s `$items` list, and add a case to
`Compiler::to_plain_text()`. A block with no plain-text case silently vanishes from the
text part of every campaign that uses it.

## CSV import is chunked — keep it resumable

`CSV::import()` takes `offset` / `line` / `max_rows` / `max_seconds` and returns the
byte offset it stopped at plus `done`. The offset is taken **after a completed row**,
so resuming can neither re-import nor skip one — don't move it. `line` is threaded
through so error messages name the real line in the file rather than restarting per
chunk. Both limits default to `0` (= no limit) so a direct call behaves as it always
did; the admin screen opts in via `_ajax_import_step()`.

## Not built yet (deliberately)

Automations, the contact profile + activity timeline, bounce/complaint handling (the
statuses exist but nothing writes them — that needs a feedback loop or an ESP webhook),
public webhooks, and the ESP provider add-ons. Check the Phase 0 report before designing
any of them differently.

Track record worth keeping: double opt-in (1.0.2) and tags/segments (1.0.3) both shipped
with **no migration** because the Phase 1 schema anticipated them. Campaigns (1.0.5) was
the first change that genuinely needed new tables — and it added tables rather than
altering existing ones, which is the cheap kind.
